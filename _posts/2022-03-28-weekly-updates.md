I've been reading through tons and tons and tons of code, and I've narrowed down some more key things that help build some components for TeamCTG
Learning a million and one things about object-oriented programming. I've also built the object for a Confetti Bits notifications component, so now I need to add some functionality and extra methods, and we should be good to go!

- I learned a better way to autoload classes to make them publicly accessible throughout the program
- I learned a million new functions and how to hook into them to build onto TeamCTG even more

### "Focusing on Urgency"
- Focus on what's important
- Ask questions like "What is the absolute dead date you need this by?"
- We have a lot of things open but no absolute deadlines
- Generally with projects and when we're asked, we determine deadlines according to us, and don't typically ask when their deadline is
- We usually have to create things when people ask us for something


#### Pending
- Boxes are back
