title: My Big Why
---

I, Dustin, vow to live purposefully. I am committed to intelligence, continuous improvement, and making a difference. I will use my talents in creative arts, programming, and education to create a better world for the disabled, abused, and less privileged; a world that has less injustice, racism, and violence. I will help them by actively listening, visualizing, and dedicating my time to the betterment of their circumstances. I will know I am living my legacy and my big why when I have gathered a following of inspired individuals who seek to uplift others and enact positive change through messaging and emotional intelligence. I dedicate my life and surrender my mind to this purpose.
